Game Instructions

When the game starts you will be asked which difficulty setting to play, type the letter for the difficulty of choice.
You move you player with the arrow keys. The green bar is your hitpoints, the blue bar is how many hitpoints you've lost. 
The red bar is the timer, if it reaches the bottom of the screen the finish line appears. 
The purple bar is your energy, every time you try to go faster or slow down you use energy, it will slowly return.
Drive the eskimo into the finish line to win. If you run out of hitpoints you lose.
If the Polar Bear catches you he will drain life every 3/4 of a second or 45 frames.
You cannot kill the bear only outrun it.
If the bear hits a tree it must find a way around it before it can chase you, if it gets too low it will crash through the 
tree and chase you at a faster pace for a brief bit of time.
